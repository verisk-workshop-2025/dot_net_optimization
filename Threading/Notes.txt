Call a function in a thread:
--> Thread thread1 = new Thread(() => DoWork("Task 1 - Worker"));

Start the thread:        
--> thread1.Start();
            
Join() is used to pause the current thread — in this case, the main thread — until the specified thread finishes execution.
--> thread1.Join();
